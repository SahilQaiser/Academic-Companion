<h1>  Course No:  MCA-106-DCE 

<br> Course Title: Computer Architecture </h1><br>
<br><h2>Unit 1:</h2><br>
<h3>     Data representation: signed number representation, fixed and floating point representations. Computer arithmetic: addition and subtraction, multiplication, division – nonrestoring and restoring techniques, floating point arithmetic; Combinatorial Logic: Boolean algebra, simplification of Boolean expressions, k-map, tabulation method. Implementation of Boolean functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, multiplexer, de-multiplexer) with logic gates; Sequential logic: flip – flops, latches, synchronous and asynchronous logic, finite State machines (moore, mealy), StateTransition Tables state assignment, excitation table. Implementation of Sequential functions:(counters, registers, sequential adder/subtractor) using flip-flops and memory (e.g. micro-coded control unit). !  
</h3>

<br><h2>Unit 2:</h2><br>
<h3>   The Processor Architecture: Von-Neumann and Non-Von-Neumann Machines, introduction to: ( RISC & CISC); (Designing a hypothetical CPU) Instruction Set design: Data representation, register sets, types of Instructions, Addressing techniques; ALU/Datapath design: operation codes(opcodes), arithmetic operations, logical operations; Control Unit design: hardwired and micro-programmed design approaches.    
 </h3>

<br><h2>Unit 3:</h2><br>
<h3> The CPU Buses & I/O systems: local buses (address buses, data buses, and control buses), System buses(bus controller and bus arbiter), DMA(principle, modes of operations: Burst,cycle stealing, transparent); Pipelining: Basic concepts of pipelining, throughput and speedup of Datapaths, pipeline hazards; Memory Hierarchy: hierarchical memory organization, basics of cache (types, mappings, replacement algorithms, write policies, performance/speedup), virtual memory. ! !
