  <br>Course Title: Advanced Computer Architecture </h1><br>
<br><h2>Unit 1:</h2><br>
<h3>   Introduction to Parallel Processing: basic concepts (Program, process, thread,concurrent & parallel languages), classification of parallel architectures, basic parallelisation techniques and their application in various parallel architectures;  Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP):  dependencies &hazards (Data, control, resource), dynamic scheduling, basic compiler techniques for exposing ILP,  speculations, preserving sequential consistency, the speedup potential of ILP; Introduction to various ILP approaches (Pipelined, VLIW and superscaler processors):  principles, structures and performance. !
